README for Arbitrage Trading Bot
Overview
This GitHub repository contains code for an arbitrage trading bot that operates on cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Bybit. The bot identifies price discrepancies between these two exchanges and executes trades to capitalize on these differences. It's designed to run continuously, monitoring price changes and executing trades when profitable opportunities are detected.

Features
Price Fetching: Retrieves real-time bid and ask prices for a specified trading pair from both Binance and Bybit.
Arbitrage Detection: Calculates the profitability of arbitrage opportunities based on trading fees and price differences.
Order Execution: Places concurrent buy and sell orders on Binance and Bybit to exploit identified arbitrage opportunities.
Telegram Integration: Sends notifications to a specified Telegram chat about trading activities and potential issues.
Error Handling: Manages exceptions and network issues to ensure continuous operation.
Stop Command Check: Listens for a stop command via Telegram to safely terminate the bot's operation.
Dependencies
requests: To make HTTP requests to exchange APIs and Telegram bot.
aiohttp: For asynchronous HTTP requests.
threading: To handle concurrent tasks like fetching prices and placing orders.
asyncio: For asynchronous programming.
matplotlib.pyplot: For potential data visualization (commented out).
binance.client: Binance API client for trading and data fetching.
binance.enums and binance.exceptions: For Binance-specific enums and exception handling.
pybit.unified_trading: Bybit API client.
decimal: For precise decimal arithmetic.
Configuration
Before running the bot, API keys for Binance and Bybit must be set up, along with Telegram bot tokens for notifications.

Usage
The main function initiates a continuous loop that fetches prices, checks for arbitrage opportunities, executes trades, and sends Telegram notifications. It handles various operational exceptions to ensure continuous trading.

Important Note: The commented-out sections (numpy, math, position checks, and stop command) indicate potential areas for future development or customization.

Security and Privacy
Ensure that your API keys and secrets are securely stored and never shared. The Telegram token and chat_id in the code should be replaced with your own to maintain privacy and control.

Disclaimer
This bot is for educational purposes and demonstrates basic concepts in arbitrage trading. Users should be aware of the risks involved in automated trading and cryptocurrency trading.
